Bahá’ís see the young as the most precious treasure a community can possess.
In them are the promise and guarantee of the future. Yet, in order for this promise to be realised,
children need to receive spiritual nourishment. In a world where the joy and innocence of childhood
can be so easily overwhelmed by the aggressive pursuit of materialistic ends, the moral and spiritual
education of children assumes vital importance.

<blockquote>
   “Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. 
   Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, 
   and enable mankind to benefit therefrom.”
