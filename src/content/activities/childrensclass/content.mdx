Bahá’ís see the young as the most precious treasure a community can possess.
In them are the promise and guarantee of the future. Yet, in order for this promise to be realised,
children need to receive spiritual nourishment. In a world where the joy and innocence of childhood
can be so easily overwhelmed by the aggressive pursuit of materialistic ends, the moral and spiritual
education of children assumes vital importance.

The Baha'i community therefore has endeavoured to bring spiritual nourishment in the form of
classes for spiritual and moral education. These classes emphasize the acquisition of spiritual
qualities - for example, truthfulness, generosity, purity of heart, and kindness, to name a few
— which are considered attributes of God that are reflected in the mirror of the human heart.
The aim is to do this by learning prayers, telling stories, singing songs, playing games and
engaging in artistic and dramatic activities as well as learning quotations on these qualities.
The goal is for the children to reach a stage in which they can understand and act upon the
imperative to tend to their own spiritual development and contribute to the well-being of society.

<blockquote>
   “Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. 
   Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, 
   and enable mankind to benefit therefrom.”
