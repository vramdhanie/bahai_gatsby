A study circle is a small group that meets at least once or twice a week for a few hours,
usually in the home of one of its members, to study the course materials. Anyone aged fifteen or older,
whether a Bahá’í or not, is welcome to take part. The group is brought together by a tutor associated
with the training institute. Tutors do not hold any special status. They are simply those who are
further along in their study of the materials. Everyone can potentially serve as a tutor on some occasions,
while taking part as a member of a study circle on others. All those participating are seen as
active agents of their own learning, and tutors strive to create an atmosphere that encourages
individuals to assume ownership for the educational process in which they are engaged.
A study circle should be a space that leads to the spiritual and moral empowerment of individuals.
