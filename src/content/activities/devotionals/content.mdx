Devotional meetings spring up naturally in a community where a conversation about the spiritual
dimension of human existence is growing. In diverse settings, Bahá’ís and their friends and families
unite with one another in prayer. There are no rituals; no one individual has any special role.
Meetings consist largely of reading prayers and passages from the Bahá’í sacred texts in an
informal yet respectful atmosphere. A spirit of communal worship is generated by these simple gatherings,
and this spirit begins to permeate the community’s collective endeavours.

<blockquote>
   “…true faith is no mere acknowledgement of the unity of God, 
   but rather the living of a life that will manifest all the perfections and virtues…”
