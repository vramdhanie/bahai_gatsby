Falling between the ages of 12 and 15 and representing a transition from childhood to youth,
young adolescents—referred to as “junior youth”—experience rapid physical, intellectual, and
emotional changes. Their spiritual powers expand. A new level of awareness fosters in them an
increased interest in profound questions and in their talents and abilities. During this short and
critical three-year period, ideas about the individual and society that may very well shape the rest
of their lives are formed. However, delight at these new powers is often combined with feelings of worry,
discomfort, and doubt that may produce contradictions in behaviour. Directing their new abilities
towards selfless service to humanity is therefore needed at this age.

<blockquote>
   "Although your realities are shaped by a broad diversity of circumstances, 
   yet a desire to bring about constructive change and a capacity for meaningful service, 
   both characteristic of your stage of life, are neither limited to any race or nationality, 
   nor dependent upon material means. This bright period of youth you share is experienced by 
   all—but it is brief, and buffeted by numerous social forces. How important it is, then, to 
   strive to be among those who, in the words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, ‘plucked the fruit of life’."
